                                publication on the Rentals site. These Forms are merely to provide information and examples for self-help purposes. 
                                The Firm strives to keep the Forms accurate, current and up-to-date. However, because the law changes rapidly, 
                                the Firm cannot guarantee that all of the information on the Rentals site is completely current. The law is different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and may be subject to interpretation by different courts. The law is a personal matter, and no Forms like the kind published on the Rentals site can fit every circumstance. Furthermore, the Forms are not legal advice and are not guaranteed to be correct, complete or up-to-date. Therefore, if you need legal advice for your specific problem, 
                                you must consult a licensed attorney in your area. Except as part of a Firm Legal Engagement (defined below), we do not review any information you input on the Forms for legal accuracy or sufficiency, draw legal conclusions, provide opinions about your selection of forms, or apply the law to the facts of your situation. If you need legal advice for a specific problem, you should consult with a licensed attorney. Use of the Forms or any other legal information published on the Rentals site is not a substitute for legal advice from a qualified attorney licensed to practice in an appropriate jurisdiction. Communications between you, the Firm, and/or Rentals may not be protected as privilege communications under the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine. Also, if you submit questions to the Firm or Rentals, the communications between you and the individual who answers your question may not be protected as privileged communications under the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine. Your use of the Forms does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and Gordon & Rees Scully Mansukhani, LLP, or between you and any Gordon & Rees Scully Mansukhani, LLP employee or representative, unless you specifically enter into a Legal Services Agreement executed by an authorized partner of the Firm. Unless you are otherwise represented by an attorney, including any external attorney, you represent yourself in any legal matter you undertake through use of our Forms.
